# Offensive_Language_Detection_model
Model that detects offensive tweets using the OLID dataset

To answer the research question on how to detect offensive language in text data, a decision tree classifier and a random forest to do a binary classification (OFF or NOT) of offensive language were created. These algorithms were created using the OLID datasets, which contain information from 14100 tweets divided into two categories: 13240 for the training and 860 for the test set .These datasets were originally created for the OffensEval-2019 competition.
